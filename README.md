# HireHub – Job Portal Web Application

HireHub is a Java-based Job Portal web application developed using JSP, Servlets, Hibernate (HQL), JSTL, and MySQL, following the MVC architecture.
The application allows job seekers to search and apply for jobs using normal and advanced filters with pagination. To ensure authenticity, only a single Admin is authorized to post and manage job listings. External recruiters must contact the Admin to publish jobs.

# Key Features

  1. Job search with normal & advanced filters  
  2. Pagination using offset and limit  
  3. OTP-based authentication (Signup & Forgot Password)  
  4. Secure configuration handling (DB & Email credentials)  
  5. Clean MVC-based design

# Technologies Used:

Java, JSP, Servlets, Hibernate, JSTL, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Apache Tomcat

# Future Goals

  1. Enable support for multiple Admin accounts to manage job postings and platform operations  
  2. Introduce Recruiter accounts to allow verified recruiters to post and manage their own job listings  
  3. Implement role-based access control for Admins, Recruiters, and Job Seekers  
  4. Migrate the application to Spring Core and Spring Boot for better scalability and maintainability
